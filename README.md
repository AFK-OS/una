Una is a really simple MPR helper (written in Bash lol). It was created since the official MPR helper, `tap` (written by `hunterwittenborn`) had issues with handling dependencies from the MPR and regular APT dependencies. Una doesn't intend to be a replacement for `tap`, but instead a simple tool which you use in place of `tap install` to install and remove packages (but I'm interested in adding other features such as package search and showing package info in future).
