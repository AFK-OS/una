== NAME
una - a complete mpr helper

== SYNOPSIS
*una install* [_package_]
*una remove* [_package_]
*una search* _search-query_
*una update*
*una upgrade*
*una list*

== DESCRIPTION
Una is a complete MPR helper written in `bash` (kinda demonstrates the power of shell scripts lol). It was created since the only other helper which is still being maintained, `tap`, had issues with handling dependencies from the MPR and regular APT dependencies. Una is a replacement for `tap` which has implemented all the features present in `tap` and more.

*install* _package_ ...::
Installs the specified packages onto the system.
+
If any specified packages are available from multiple sources, *una* will prompt the user to choose which source to install from and then will proceed with the transaction.

*remove* _package_ ...::
Removes the specified packages from the system.
+
If removing any of the specified packages would cause an essential (*dpkg*(1)) package to be removed, *una* aborts the transaction.

*search* _query params_ ...::
Searches APT and the MPR for each of the specified query parameters.

*update*::
Updates the APT and MPR repository caches on the local system.

*upgrade*::
Checks if any installed packages have upgrades available for installation.

*list*::
Lists all APT and MPR packages.
